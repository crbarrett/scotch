Kininvie distillery was built in 1990 to provide additional single malt capacity for William Grant & Sons to be used in blended and vatted whiskies.  Kininvie means End of the Fair Plain.  Kininvie as a distillery shares a great deal of the Balvenie facilities with the mash tuns and cooler equipment side by side.  The 9 washbacks are located in a separate room from those of the Balvenie and the Kininvie still building can be viewed from an eastward facing window in the tun room some 200 meters off.  Kininvie shares a mill with the Balvenie and a cooperage and stores with Balvenie and Glenfiddich.

Kininvie wash stills have a distinctly pear shape (http://www.flickr.com/photos/mirthful/2915286103/in/photostream/) (these remind me of Bunnahabhain) while the spirit stills appear more bell shaped (http://www.flickr.com/photos/mirthful/2915285865/in/photostream/).  This is in contrast to Glenfiddich which have the classic onion shape and the Balvenie still which reside somewhere in between with their somewhat round tops below the boil ball changing to straight sided about halfway down.

The Kininvie stills are in fact silent at this moment in time as there is no demand for new malt, but it could be restarted at any time.  It is expected that this will be the case throughout Kininvie's life cycle as it will be revived as malt is needed for blends in William Grant products and perhaps will play a lesser role once the malt distillery at Girvan, called Ailsa Bay, reaches full production.

Kininvie is and always was intended as a blending component of the Wiliam Grant blended whisky products, but it is a prime component of the "Monkey Shoulder" vatting of 27 bourbon casks from the three main William Grant distilleries, Kininvie, Balvenie, and Glenfiddich.  Kinvinie in teaspooned editions have also appeared from cask sales to independent bottlers such as Glenscoma's Aldunie bottling that got them sued.  They would have been fine had they not indicated on the back of the bottle that it was a vatting of Kininvie and a few drops of another Dufftown malt (Balvenie and Glenfiddich).

As all 'Hazelwood' bottlings have been tied to Janet Sheed Roberts (William Grant's granddaughter) it may be important to know that her birthday is August 13th, 1901, and she will be turning 110 in 2011.  She's also the 15th oldest person in Britain (http://oldestinbritain.webs.com/oldestlivingbritons.htm).

Bottlings
Hazelwood Centennial Reserve 20 years old (40.0%, OB, Bottled 2001) - This item is not in fact a Kininvie of any kind but rather a vatting of 100 casks of at least 20 years old for the 100th birthday of Janet Sheed Roberts (granddaughter of William Grant).  It can be assumed that there is no Kininvie in the blend as it would only have been max 11 years old when this was released).  2001 bottles were released to employees of Wm. Grant & Sons.
